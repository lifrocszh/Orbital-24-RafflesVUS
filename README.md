# NUS Orbital 2024 (RafflesVUS) - Milestone 1

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

# **Motivation**

It can be challenging to balance academics and a meaningful hall experience both at the same time. 

As hall residents ourselves, we find it hard to track and manage our various hall commitments and activities. 

While there are currently some initiatives that aim to solve the above, we believe it could be better integrated together in 1 system just like how the UNIVUS app does it for NUS. 

# **Aim**

To provide an all-in-one platform for all hall-related activities. 

# **Scope of Project**

The app provides a platform for residents to book facilities, RSVP events, and publish announcements. 

**Features to be completed by mid of June**
1.	***Frontend and backend integration*** - Users will be able to log in via their google accounts
2.	***Booking of facilities*** - Bookings will be reflected in the homepage, and blocked out in the bookings pages so others are unable to book.
3.	***Announcements page*** - Set up the page where users can publish announcements for various events

**Features to be completed by end of June**

1. ***Announcements page*** - Allow RSVP functions, and publishers can be notified of the numbers and people attending

**Features to be completed by the mid of July**

1.	***Administrative accounts*** - Given certain password, users can be granted admin access
